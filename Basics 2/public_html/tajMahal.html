        <p> The Taj Mahal in Persian for Crown of Palaces[4]) is an 
            ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. 
            It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–1658), to house the 
            tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a complex nearly 17 hectares 
            (42 acres) in area,[5] which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded 
            on three sides by a crenellated wall. </p>
            <p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 
            but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed 
            to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, 
            which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (US$827 million). The construction project employed 
            some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.</p>
            <p>The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and 
            one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". Described by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore 
            as "the tear-drop on the cheek of time", it is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol 
            of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the 
            New7Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.</p></font>
