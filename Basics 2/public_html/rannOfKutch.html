            <p>The Great Rann of Kutch, along with the Little Rann of Kutch and the Banni grasslands 
                on its southern edge, is situated in the district of Kutch and comprises some 30,000 
                square kilometres (10,000 sq mi) between the Gulf of Kutch and the mouth of the Indus 
                River. The marsh can be accessed from the village of Kharaghoda in 
                Surendranagar District.</p>
            <p>
                In India's summer monsoon, the flat desert of salty clay and mudflats, which average 
                15 meters above sea level, fills with standing water. In very wet years, the wetland 
                extends from the Gulf of Kutch on the west through to the Gulf of Cambay on the east.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The area was a vast shallow of the Arabian Sea until continuing geological uplift 
                closed off the connection with the sea, creating a vast lake that was still navigable 
                during the time of Alexander the Great. The Ghaggar River, which presently empties 
                into the desert of northern Rajasthan, formerly emptied into the Rann of Kutch, but 
                the lower reaches of the river dried up as its upstream tributaries were captured by 
                the Indus and Ganges thousands of years ago. Traces of the delta and its distributary 
                channels on the northern boundary of the Rann of Kutch were documented by the Geological 
                Survey of India in 2000.</p>
            <p>
                
                The Luni River, which originates in Rajasthan, drains into the desert in the northeast 
                corner of the Rann. Other rivers feeding into the marsh include the Rupen from the east 
                and the West Banas River from the northeast.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are sandy islets of thorny scrub, forming a wildlife sanctuary and a 
                breeding ground for some of the largest flocks of greater and lesser flamingos. 
                Wildlife, including the Indian wild ass, shelter on islands of higher ground, 
                called bets, during the flooding. </p>
