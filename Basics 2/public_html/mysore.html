        <p>Mysore officially renamed as Mysuru, is the third most populous city in 
            the state of Karnataka, India. Located at the base of the Chamundi Hills 
            about 146 km (91 mi) southwest of the state capital Bangalore, it is spread 
            across an area of 128.42 km2 (50 sq mi). According to the provisional results 
            of the 2011 national census of India, the population is 887,446. Mysore City 
            Corporation is responsible for the civic administration of the city, which is also 
            the headquarters of the Mysore district and the Mysore division.</p>
        <p>Mysore served as the capital city of Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries, 
            from 1399 until 1974. The Kingdom was ruled by the Wodeyar dynasty, except for 
            a brief period in the late 18th century when Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were in 
            power. Patrons of art and culture, the Wodeyars contributed significantly to the 
            cultural growth of the city. The cultural ambience and achievements of Mysore 
            earned it the sobriquet Cultural capital of Karnataka.</p>        
        <p>Mysore is noted for its palaces, including the Mysore Palace, and for the 
            festivities that take place during the Dasara festival when the city receives 
            a large number of tourists. It lends its name to the Mysore style of painting, 
            the sweet dish Mysore Pak, the Mysore Peta (a traditional silk turban) and the 
            garment known as the Mysore silk saree. Tourism is the major industry, while 
            information technology has emerged as a major employer alongside the traditional 
            industries. Mysore depends on rail and bus transport for inter-city connections. 
            The city was the location of the first private radio station in India. Mysore 
            houses Mysore University, which has produced several notable authors, particularly 
            in the field of Kannada literature. Cricket is the most popular sport in the city.</p>
